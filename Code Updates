I make use of the key setup for use in the Tobii Eyetracking Utility. In my case, I use the CTRL key to the left of the keyboard as the Mouse skip key for use in interactable behaviour.

In my ONGAZE event handler, you can use the sendkeys function to automatically trigger the pressing of the key. 

                    SendKeys.Send("^a")
                    
Note: keys are case sensitive; the code above triggers the use of the left CTRL key.

You can also call and trigger functions to create a user profile, calibrate and recalibrate the user. Try them out. They must be run after the host is started.

            Dim EyeXHost As New EyeXFramework.Forms.FormsEyeXHost
	          '
	          EyeXHost.Start() ' Start using the EyeTracker
            ' Tobii Eye Functions
            EyeXHost.LaunchProfileCreation()
            '
            EyeXHost.LaunchCalibrationTesting()
            '
            EyeXHost.LaunchRecalibration()
