I make use of the key setup for use in the Tobii Eyetracking Utility. In my case, I use the CTRL key to the left of keyboard as the Mouse skip key for use in interactable behaviour.

In my ONGAZE event handler, you can use the sendkeys function to automatically trigger the pressing of the key. 

                    SendKeys.Send("^a")
                    
Note: in some cases keys are case sensitive; the code above trfiggers the use of the elft CTRL key.
